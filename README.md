## CPPGI
*A small and simple, statically included CGI library in C++*

## About

I wanted to explore CGI, but didn't want to learn a framework. I like
getting my hands dirty, and want to experience the process of building
a complete set of tools for common CGI tasks on my personal site.

## Features

 - Accepts a single POST and cleans up the inputs for other use.
 - Allows for hardcoded HTML to be easily output, so that You aren't
   retyping things over and over. DRY.

## Goals

 - Plaintext State Storage support
 - Encryption support
 
## Limitations

 - Only use the C++ standard library & extensions.
 - Warnings are Errors. C++17.
 - <500 SLOC.
